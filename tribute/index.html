        <h1>Here's a time line of Lenin's life:</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1870</strong> - Vladimir Ilich Ulyanov is born on
            <time datetime="1870-04-22">April 22</time> in Simbirsk, Russia. The
            town is later renamed Ulyanovsk in his honor, and he changes his own
            surname to Lenin in <time datetime="1901">1901</time>. He is the
            third of six children in a close-knit, well-educated family. He
            displays an early passion for learning and graduates first in his
            class from high school.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1887</strong> - Accused of conspiring with a terrorist group
            to assassinate Emperor Alexander III, Lenin's beloved older brother
            Aleksandr was executed. Lenin, who is only 17 at the time, becomes
            the head of the family, as his father was already dead. This episode
            marks a turning point in Lenin's life, as it turns him towards
            revolutionary action.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1887</strong> - Shortly after his brother's death, Lenin
            enrolls in the imperial Kazan University to study law. However, he
            is expelled after three months for participating in a student
            assembly. He spends the next year on his grandfather's estate with
            his exiled older sister, where he meets older revolutionaries and
            studies political literature, including Marx's Das Kapital.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1891</strong> - After studying in Samara, Lenin passes his
            examinations with a first in all subjects and receives his law
            degree. He begins practicing law in Samara, working primarily with
            peasants and artisans. This experience sparks his loathing for the
            legal system's class bias. He continues to practice law after moving
            to St. Petersburg, but his work serves as a cover for his growing
            involvement with revolutionary Marxist circles.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1895</strong> - Lenin and other Marxists unite various
            groups in the Union for the Struggle for the Liberation of the
            Working Class, meant to support workers and educate them in Marxism.
            In <time datetime="1895-12">December 1895</time>, Lenin and the
            other leaders of the Union are arrested. Lenin is later exiled to
            Siberia, where he marries his fianc√©e, Nadezhda Krupskaya.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1900</strong> - After his release from exile in Siberia,
            Lenin moves to Munich in
            <time datetime="1900-01">January 1900</time> and is later joined by
            his wife. He and several other editors launch the newspaper Iskra
            ("The Spark"), hoping to unify the Russian Marxist groups scattered
            around Europe into one Social-Democratic party. Lenin then returns
            to St. Petersburg to continue to work with the revolutionary
            movement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1905</strong> - Frustrated with Russia's political structure
            and war with Japan, citizens call for reform. However, an
            unintentional massacre on
            <time datetime="1905-01-09">January 9, 1905</time> sets the Russian
            Revolution of 1905 in motion. The czar responds with limited
            reforms, but Lenin argues that the workers must lead Russia in a
            true Socialist revolution to truly transform the nation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1912</strong> - After arguing for years over the methods
            with which to bring about a Socialist revolution, the Russian
            Marxist party splits into two groups at a party conference in
            Prague. Lenin's Bolsheviks believe the workers, as the true
            proletariat, must lead the revolution, while the Mensheviks believe
            the bourgeoisie should be in control.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1917</strong> - In 1917, Russia deposes the czar, and
            leaders of the bourgeois liberal parties set up a Provisional
            Government. On <time datetime="1917-11-07">November 7</time> Lenin
            leads the Bolsheviks in deposing the Provisional Government in what
            is later called the October Revolution. Lenin is made Chairman of
            the new Soviet state, but counterrevolutionaries plunge Russia into
            civil war.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1918</strong> - Soon after civil war breaks out between
            Lenin's Soviet government (known as Reds) and anti-Soviet forces
            (known as Whites), an assassin fires two bullets at Lenin as he
            leaves a speech. He quickly recovers from the attempted
            assassination. Commanded by Lenin's colleague Leon Trotsky, the
            Worker's and Peasants' Red Army (representing Soviet forces) finally
            defeats the anti-Soviet White Army within Russia in 1920. However,
            the war continues in neighboring regions until 1922.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1922</strong> - The Union of Socialist Soviet Republics
            (USSR) is formally established on
            <time datetime="1922-12-30">December 30</time> after years of civil
            war within Russia and its neighboring regions, now part of the USSR.
            Lenin has achieved his dream, but the party is beginning to stray
            from his Socialist vision.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1923</strong> - Despite suffering from semi-paralysis, Lenin
            dictates a series of articles and his political "Testament" to his
            secretary, finishing on
            <time datetime="1923-01-04">January 4</time>. The "Testament"
            describes his fear that the party will destabilize under the
            leadership of Trotsky and Joseph Stalin, who is rapidly
            consolidating power as general secretary.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1924</strong> - After suffering a series of strokes and
            illnesses, some stemming from the attempted assassination of 1918,
            Lenin dies on <time datetime="1924-01-21">January 21</time>. Despite
            his attempts to reverse Stalin's consolidation of power, the Soviet
            state continues to move farther away from Lenin's dream of Socialism
            after his death.
